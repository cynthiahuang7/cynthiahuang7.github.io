There is something about Ove that deeply touched my heart, so much so that every reading session ended with tears. I would like to believe that those tears carry a special meaning, and yet, I could not pinpoint what it was.

It is not so much about him losing his father at an early age and having to fend for himself. It is not so much about the losses that he and Sonja endured in their life: witnessing the house he built burn down, the passing of Sonjaâ€™s father and their beloved cat, and the heartbreaking miscarriage caused by a drunk driver. And it is also not so much about him losing Sonja to cancer and giving in to despair.

Perhaps it is how he became a man of black and white, never compromising his principles for a single day of his life. To avoid burdening others during his suicidal attempt, he canceled his newspaper subscription, tidied up his house, and diligently completed his usual neighborhood inspection in the early morning. He decided to be a man of integrity during his childhood with his father, and he honored that commitment until his death. Over the years, he learned to fiercely defend the simple joys he held dear. A man of such simplicity can indeed become remarkably stubborn when he knows what he's fighting for.

Perhaps it is the way he held Sonja, all the color in his life, with all his heart his entire life, from the very first moment he saw her. Ove's affection for Sonja manifested in the sweetest and most romantic gestures, often without him even realizing it: months of train journeys just to be with her, crafting handmade bookshelves, designing custom kitchen counters, and constructing a wheelchair-accessible path for Sonja's convenience in her teaching career. During the years that Sonja was fighting for what was good, Ove was fighting for her.

Perhaps it is how he eventually opened his heart to his neighbors, choosing to be the loving and caring man he had always been, not only for Sonja but also for those he barely knew. Over the years, he had certainly grown grumpier. He couldn't find a way to reconcile the loss from that fateful car accident and love life as Sonja had. The sense of powerlessness to protect what he held dear haunted him. Nevertheless, he remained the man who would go to great lengths to assist those in need: saving his neighbors from a fiery inferno while his own house burned, mending fences during their honeymoon, and rescuing people from peril on the train tracks even when he himself was grappling with suicidal thoughts. Thanks to Pravaneh and those who extended a helping hand to this initially bitter curmudgeon, he discovered how to embrace and share the profound love and tenderness that had always run deeply in him.

Life can bring forth many unexpected happenings, often cruel and sweet at the same time. The day Ove lost his family house, he encountered Sonja on a train, a meeting that turned out to be the most beautiful moment of his life. On the final day of their blissful honeymoon, a tragic accident took away their unborn child and confined Sonja to a wheelchair. The day he contemplated suicide, he crossed paths with Pravaneh and her family, who later became the beacon of light that dispelled the shadows in his life. No one knows what is around the corner, and yet, Ove stayed true to himself, stayed strong in the face of adversity, and stayed open to love in all those moments. And that is something.
